		<h1>Disagreement among the Tor Directory Authorities</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="pre_description">
		<p>
			There are a few thousand relays in the Tor network that clients can choose from to build circuits. All these
			relays need to register at a small number of central directory authorities to announce themselves and their
			capabilities in the network. The directory authorities exchange their views of the relays in the network,
			and the capabilities of each, once per hour and then publish a new network status consensus that clients use
			to build circuits.
		</p>

		<p>
			In theory, the directory authorities would unanimously agree that a given relay does or does not have a
			given capability, but in practice, they don't. In most cases it's sufficient if a majority of directory
			authorities agrees on a capability, though thin majorities make the network less robust than it could be
			against single directory failures or opinion changes.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following graph shows how much the directory authorities disagree about certain capabilities. If all the
			directory authorities agree on a capability, this is displayed in dark green. If all of them agree that a
			relay does not have a capability, which may also be a perfectly valid case, this is shown in bright white.
			But everything in between, displayed in brown or yellow, can be considered unhealthy for the network and may
			indicate problems in the underlying algorithms.

				behind restrictive proxies, or for some similar reason (not all directory authorities vote on this flag)
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>Exit</dt>
			<dd>Relays that permit exiting to at least two ports out of 80, 443, and 6667 and which should be selected
				by clients for the exit position of circuits, rather than in the guard or middle positions

			<dt>Named</dt>
			<dd>Relays that have their nickname bound to a fingerprint by the directory authorities and that clients

			<dt>Measured</dt>
			<dd>Relays that have had their bandwidth measured by the directory authorities and that clients will
				prefer over unmeasured relays when selecting relays for their circuits (note that Measured is
